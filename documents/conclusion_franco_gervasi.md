# Conclusion Franco

The work was exciting. The highlight was receiving posts from other applications where activitypub also implemented standards. Working with Pascal was great. I was able to learn a lot from him and the communication between us worked well.
I mainly work on the frontend. Vuejs turned out to be a good framework. The longer the project took, the more the benefits of Vuejs became apparent. With vuetify you had a library with good standard components that could appear in an application. The front end can be started with mock data or a backend can be specified where the data is called.
I am satisfied with the result. There are some points that I would do differently now than at the beginning. Of course it still has some bugs. Unfortunately the time passed in flight to fix further bugs or to improve the display.

## Positive conclusion

- The display of the post that has been replied to.
- The search for new users is well implemented.
- Simple design
- Mock Date and Unit test

##Â Negative conclusion

- The data from the server / mock are processed in different components instead of centrally in the store.
- That the application is not yet mobile enough
- Understanding ActivitPub was very challenging.

## What did I learn from the project

- Got to know Vuejs extensively
- Write a test
- Set up the front end via Docker
- That I have to get better at reviewing
