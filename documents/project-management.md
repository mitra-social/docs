## Project period

| Project start | End of project |
| ------------- | -------------- |
| 2019-09-26    | 2020-08-28     |

## Project goals

Software is to be developed which enables the following goals and functions:

- You want to be able to register and then log in with your user.
- User should receive posts from other users who are followed.
- Contemporary and simple design.
- Easy handling.

## Justification, benefits

- Many implementations of the Standard ActivityPub are clones from well-known social media, you want to get the best stuff of them all.
- Reduce the limitations of how to implement activity pub.

## Non-goals

- Additional functions should be implemented after the master's thesis, as there is not enough time for a comprehensive implementation of the ActivityPub standard.

## Criteria for the successful end of the project

- A working installation where a logged in user can see posts.
- Documentation complete.

## Necessary core project team

- Software Engineer
- PHP Developer
- Javascript Developer

## Risks & measures

* **R-01** Unknown protocol ActivityPub - No project member has ever worked with this protocol so the risk is that we don't manage to get it working at all.
* **R-02** Slow third parties - Due to the decentralized approach of the project there is the possbility that remote servers are responding very slow or not at all
* **R-03** None-standard conform third parties - Die to the decentralized approach of the project and various implementations of the protocol on different servers there is the possibility that server instances not always behave the same and don't implement the ActivityPub standard properly.
