# Brainstorming

* How to deal with a huge amount of follows from a single user. (User A follows 1000 other (remote) users)?
* Should we treat local users differently than remote users?
  * Out of scope
* In what format do we store content (especially text/notes)?
  * Maybe out of scope until we start implementing write access
*
